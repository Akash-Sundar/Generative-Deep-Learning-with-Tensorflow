(Implemented using both PyTorch and Tensorflow)

**Basic GANs**: GANs and DCGANs implemented on CelebA dataset

**Better GANs**: Improved upon the loss function and others to overcome disadvantages of GANs, namely, Mode collapse

**Evaluating GANs**: Defining evalution metrics to evaluate the performance of GANs in order to choose between 2 GAN architectures

**StyleGAN**: The latest advancement to GAN. Uses a feature mapping layer and progressive growth of image sizes for higher fidelity images almost indistinguishable from real.
